# html-AnatomyOfAHtmlTemplate

This html file contains the basic template of a html file doc.

- The "html" element is a type of markup language. This element covers the entire page's content. It is also referred to as the root element.

- The "head" element. This element serves as a container for whatever you wish to put on the HTML page that isn't the content that people will see. This contains search-engine-friendly keywords and a page description, CSS to style content, character set declarations, and more. In the next instalment of the series, you'll discover more about this.
